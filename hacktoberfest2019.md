# Hacktoberfest 2019
The 6th annual [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) event hosted by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio. The OS Community is made up of more than just developers. You matter too. The most useful project also has well written documentation and related supplemental materials.

This page contains a collection of projects seeking (or open to) documentation contributions. If you're interested in contributing to a project, make sure to review the contribition guidelines and [style guide](/styleguides.md). Want something more specific?
